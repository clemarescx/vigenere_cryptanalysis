# vigenere_cryptanalysis
An implementation of the cryptanalysis algorithm for an ASCII-based Vigenère cipher.

This was written to be added on the Rosetta Code page for the [Vigenère cipher/Cryptanalysis](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher/Cryptanalysis#Rust). It's a shameless copy/conversion of the Kotlin entry on the same page.
